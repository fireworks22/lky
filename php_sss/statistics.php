	I think that most of us know by now that 
	water is essential to our survival. We’ve 
	probably also all heard doctors say that 
	drinking roughly eight glasses a day is 
	ideal. However, what most people don’t 
	know is that warm water and hot water have 
	some exclusive benefits of their own that 
	you just can’t get when you drink water cold. 
	Here are 12 benefits of drinking hot water:
	1. Weight Loss
	Hot water is great for maintaining a healthy 
	metabolism, which is what you want if you’re 
	trying to shed a few kilos. The best way to do 
	this is to kick start your metabolism early in 
	the morning with a glass of hot water and lemon. 
	As an added bonus, hot water will help to break 
	down the adipose tissue (aka body fat) in your body.
